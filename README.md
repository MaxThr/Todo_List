# Todo List App

Welcome to the Todo List app! This application allows you to manage your daily tasks in a simple and efficient way. It was developped by [Aasa21](https://github.com/Aasa21), (Dutoit Arthur) and [MaxThr](https://github.com/MaxThr), (Thery Maxime)

## Files

1. **TODO.swift**: Defines the `Todo` struct, representing a task with a title, description, completion status, and optional due date.

2. **ViewController.swift**: Implements the main view controller managing the Todo List. It includes methods for handling table view operations, editing, and presenting Todo details.

3. **TodoViewController.swift**: Represents the view controller for creating or editing a Todo item. It includes a delegate protocol for communication with the main view controller.

4. **Checkbox.swift**: Custom UIControl representing a checkbox. It allows users to mark Todo items as complete or incomplete.

5. **CheckTableViewCell.swift**: Custom table view cell displaying Todo items with checkboxes and strikethrough for completed tasks.

## How It Works

3. **TodoViewController**: Allows users to create or edit Todo items. Users can set the title, description, and due date for a task.
